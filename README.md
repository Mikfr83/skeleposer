# Skeleposer

What is Skeleposer? It's like Shape Editor in Maya but works with skeletons (transforms). It can be used to make complex facial rigs based on joints. It's especially good for game engines and realtime graphics.

It supports a lot of cool features that make the working process nice:
* UI-friendly interface like Shape Editor.
* Mirror/flip poses
* Corrective poses
* Inbetween poses
* Drivers that activate poses.
* Directories and hierarchies.
* Two blend modes, additive and replace for poses.
* Very fast for complex facial rigs!<br>
  The rig with 100 posts each one with 100 bones computes in 130fps (amd ryzen 5 3600x)

Actually the whole facial rig can be just as simple as a sequence of poses and correctives.
